# Tunify (JunkieTuner)

Tunify or by its' original name JunkieTuner is an open source and free Guitar Tuner Android application. It is developed implementing the Yin algorithm for pitch detection. You can find more information about the specific algorithm on the relevant [paper](http://recherche.ircam.fr/equipes/pcm/cheveign/ps/2002_JASA_YIN_proof.pdf) published by Alain de Cheveigné and Hideki Kawahara in 2001.

Currently I am writing an article were I explain how the algorithm was developed and also I will start the engagement to deploy the application to Android's Play Store. When the article is ready you will be able to find it on my personal website [stavrosbarousis.com](https://stavrosbarousis.com). 

The android code was written using entirely Java, I would like to find people to contribute to the project. One of the first things that I would like to do is to re-write the project in Kotlin. From there on we should be able to enrich the application with more functionality.

Feel free to contact me at stavrosbarousis@gmail.com or through the platform from inside my personal website.

I intend to upload some patches and fixes and enhance the functionalities of the application.
